&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Welcome to Help the Helper where I mostly ramble about numbers involved in basketball and medicine. Help the helper is a basketball defensive term used to describe the teamwork that it takes to play good team defense. A good defensive player isn't just a good one-on-one defender; they also are always in position to help their teammates stop the offense get an open shot. When a teammate leaves their opponent to go help another teammate, it's imperative that someone else rotates to the now open player. This is seen most often on drives where the opposite defender has to "step up" to stop the drive as in the video below. This concept is what makes quantifying the quality of defenders impossible (at least so far) in the basketball analytics world.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;It's tough to quantify the impact that people have when part of a team. Medicine is another field where one has to "help the helper." There are so many moving parts between technology, nurses, doctors, and other staff. It takes a whole team to make sure that patients are able to get their best care. Part of the challenge of today is figuring out how to best analyze the data being collected and then integrate it into the current medical team workflow. This is one of the big questions of today that hopefully I'll be able to delve into a bit deeper (with some basketball and other random stuff along the way).
