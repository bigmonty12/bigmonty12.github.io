My name is Austin Montgomery. I am a 2nd year MD/PhD student at [Penn State College of Medicine](https://med.psu.edu/md-phd/meet-our-students) in Hershey, PA. Once upon a time, I played basketball in college. When I'm not studying for school, I'm hanging out with my wife and Bernese Mountain Dog puppy. One day, I hope to discover new ways math can help us understand and treat human illness.
