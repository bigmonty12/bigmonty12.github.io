I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia where I attended [Lakeview Academy](https://www.lakeviewacademy.com/). After moving to Salt Lake City to begin my collegiate basketball career at the University of Utah, I transferred to [Dixie State University](https://dixie.edu/) in St. George to play my final three years. While there, I became the first ever graduate of the newly implemented Bioinformatics program. Due to the local presence of Precision Genomics at Intermountain Healthcare, I was able to participate in multiple internships in cancer bioinformatics. During the summer of 2018, I was an intern in the [Ji lab](https://dna-discovery.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University where I worked closely with Dr. Charlie Xia to develop a pipeline for analyzing the microbiome and its effects on response to cancer immunotherapy. In the spring of 2019, I worked under Dr. Sharanya Raghunath of Precision Genomics to validate a tool for the detection of microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor samples. After graduation in May 2019, I hung up my basketball shoes due to injury and moved back to Salt Lake City to join the [Rothenfluh lab](http://insandoutslab.genetics.utah.edu/).
